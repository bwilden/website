## Interactions With Two Dummy Variables ##

# Let's build another dummy variable for urban/rural in our Utah and Virginia data
ut_va <- ut_va %>% 
  mutate(rural = if_else(ruralurban_cc >= 7, 1, 0))

# Two ways of creating interactions in lm()

screenreg(mod_int)

# Or
# y ~ x1 * x2
mod_int <- lm(trump_difference ~ VA*rural, data = ut_va)
screenreg(mod_int)

# How to interpret this?
# trump_difference = -24.1 + 24.6 * VA + 13.9 * rural - 8.0 * VA * rural
#       -24.1: predicted trump vote for Utah and non-rural
#        24.6: difference in trump vote between Virginia and Utah for non-rural
#        13.9: difference in trump vote between rural and non-rural for Utah
#         8.0: difference in slope for rural between Utah and Virginia

## Interactions With One Continuous Variable and One Dummy Variable ##

# Let's examine how the manufactuing proportion effects trump support in the two states

### Why do we have to include the "main effects" in addition to the interaction term?

### F test ###

# Does "State" matter?

# It is tempting to answer this question by looking at whether 
# the main effect on the VA term is significant
screenreg(mod_int)

# But that is the wrong approach. The main effect tells us only whether the *intercept* for
# VA counties is different from the intercept for Utah countries

# In order to determine whether the VA *variable* matters in general, we have to do an F-test:

mod_full <- lm(trump_difference ~ prop_manuf + VA + prop_manuf:VA, data = ut_va)
mod_restricted <- lm(trump_difference ~ prop_manuf, data = ut_va)
anova(mod_restricted, mod_full)

### Interactions between two continuous variables ###

# Here's our model
# We are interacting manufacturing proportion by white percentage
mod_cont <- lm(trump_difference ~ prop_manuf * white_pct, data = counties)
summary(mod_cont)

# This interaction effect is a lot harder to interpret

# Here is the most common way:
# Calculate the "marginal effect" of one of our interacted IVs, conditional on the value
# of the other interacted IV

# When white_pct is 0, the effect of prop_manuf on trump_diff is -0.036; 
# Each 1 unit increase in white_pct increases the effect of prop_manuf on trump_diff by 0.002

# We can think of this marginal effect as "the partial derivative with respect to prop_manuf":
# Our line: Y = -3.824 -  0.036*M + 0.075*W + 0.002*M*W
# Effect of W =    0   -  0.036   +    0    + 0.002*W
#             = -0.036 +  0.002*W

# Now we can calculate the effect of prop_manuf on trump_difference for each value of white_pct in the range
slopes <- coefficients[first_iv_name] + coefficients[interaction_name] * range

# We can calculate the standard errors for these predictions using the formula in Scott's slides; 
# this will allow us to make a confidence interval

upper <- slopes + 1.96 * SEs
lower <- slopes - 1.96 * SEs

# We see that the effect of prop_manuf on trump_difference is around 0.05 when white_pct is 50, 
# And the effect grows steeply as white_pct increases
# but the effect is negative when white_pct < 20
