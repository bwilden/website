I am a Political Science PhD student at UC San Diego working on topics related to political participation and voter turnout. Specifically, I'm interested in understanding the racial barriers to voting in the United States. My current work uses Bayesian methods to examine the impact of polling location on turnout, as well as to predict an individuals' self-identified race or ethnicity.
