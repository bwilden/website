-   **bper**: Bayesian Prediction for Ethnicity and Race

    -   \[[Github](https://github.com/bwilden/bper)\]
    -   This package provides functions for predicting an individual's race/ethnicity given their first name, last name, geo-location, political party, age, gender, and address characteristics. The method is based on a Naive Bayes classification algorithm which incorporates known ethnorace distributions over the observed characteristics to generate posterior probabilities for each individual.
